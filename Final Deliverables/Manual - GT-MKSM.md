## Introduction

This application will assist the healthcare provider in identifying social determinants of health that may potentially affect the patient's ability to receive quality care. The user will be presented with relevant items from the PRAPARE (Protocol for Assessing Patients' Assets, Risks, and Experience) assessment tool questionnaire. The result of the questionnaire will determine if the patient is subject to social determinants of health (SDH). This application will provide links to external resources available to assist the patient.

In this current version of the application, the risk assessment is limited to the SDH transportation.
